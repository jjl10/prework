# Pre-work - *Tip Calculator Prework*

**Tip Calculator Prework** is a tip calculator application for iOS.

Submitted by: **Jasmine Lee**

Time spent: **5** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [X] User can enter a bill amount, choose a tip percentage, and see the tip and total values.
* [X] User can select between tip percentages by tapping different values on the segmented control and the tip value is updated accordingly

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [ ] UI animations
* [X] Remembering the bill amount across app restarts (if <10mins)
* [ ] Using locale-specific currency and currency thousands separators.
* [ ] Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [X] additional settings screen where custom tip percentages can be inputted by user and lead to changes in the Tip Calculator home screen.

## Notes

One challenge I encountered while building the app was having the segmented control contain 3 options rather than the default of 2 because I could not figure out how to add the third option. Another challenge that I faced and resolved without explicit instructions from the prework guide was connecting the user's input for custom tips in the settings screen to changes in the tip calculator home screen.
